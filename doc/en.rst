Forest change mask
==================
*Base forest mask and fragmentation tool*

As a base forest mask and fragmentation tool, this application allows users to:

-   define an area of interest (AOI);
-   retrieve tree cover change data from the `Hansen et al. (2013) dataset <https://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6160/850>`_; and
-   combine layers to produce a forest change map for a given canopy cover threshold.

Background information on Global Forest Change
----------------------------------------------

Global forest change (GFC) provides global layers of information on tree cover and tree cover change since 2000 (at 30 m spatial resolution), consisting of:

-   tree canopy cover for the year 2000 (**treecover2000**);
-   global forest cover gain for 2000–2012 (**gain**); and
-   year of gross forest cover loss event (**lossyear**).

Select an AOI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the provided **AOI selector**, choose an AOI of your choice between different methods available in the tool. 

We provide three administrative descriptors (from level 0 to 2) and three custom shapes (drawn directly on the map, asset, or shapefile).

.. note::

    If a custom AOI from a shape or drawing is selected, you can use it directly; the upload to GEE will be launched in the background. Check your `GEE code editor <https://code.earthengine.google.com>`_ to use it elsewhere.

GFC visualization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two parameters are available to select the data: 

-   Use the slider to change the threshold to consider (between forest and non-forest areas). Once you've chosen a value, select :code:`update map` to update the interactive map layers.
-   Use the range slider to move the dates to consider in the analysis.

The new layer is a combination of GFC layers to produce a forest change map for a given canopy cover threshold. Only pixels that have tree cover above the threshold will be considered forest. Every tree-covered pixel prior to the start date will be considered as **non-forest** and every changed that occurs after the end date will be considered **stable forest**. The legend is displayed in the map. You're allowed to zoom in and out; the data will be recomputed dynamically in GEE.

When changing the value of the threshold or the dates, a new layer will be added to the map, so you can compare and select the most appropriate parameters for your analysis.

.. attention:: 

    The parameters that will be used for the next step are the final values requested of the threshold. To return to a previous value, move the slider back and select :code:`update map` again.

Export selected data 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Considering the AOI selected in **Step 1** and the parameters selected in **Step 2**, the module will generate a combination of GFC layers to produce a forest change map for a given canopy cover threshold between specific dates. It will be stored in a :code:`~/gfc_wrapper_results/<aoi_name>` folder in your SEPAL environment.

Three results will be produced:

-   the map of the forest change mask using the color tab presented in the interactive maps (:code:`..._gfc_map.tif``);
-   the distribution of each defined zone (:code:`..._gfc_stat.csv`); and
-   the legend of the raster (:code:`..._gfc_legend.pd```).

Download these three files directly from the interface using the green buttons. 

The files are named after your parameters, following this convention: :code:`<threshold>_<start_date>_<end_date>_<file>.<suffix>`

.. attention::

    The statistic computations are run in the `World Mollweide (ESRI:54009) projection <https://epsg.io/54009>`_. The results may differ if you want to get them in a local projection.
