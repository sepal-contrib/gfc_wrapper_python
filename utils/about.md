Base Forest mask tool

This application allows the user to:

- define an area of interest
- retrieve tree cover change data from the Hansen et al., (2013) dataset
- combine the layers to produce a forest change map, for a given canopy cover threshold
- use a fragmentation tool (Vogt & Ritter, 2017) to measure the integrity of forests

for more information about usage please read the [documentation](./doc/doc.md)

### Background info on GFC

GFC provides global layers of information on tree cover and tree cover change since 2000, at 30m spatial resolution and consists of:

- Tree canopy cover for the year 2000 (treecover2000)
- Global forest cover gain 2000–2012 (gain)
- Year of gross forest cover loss event (lossyear)
